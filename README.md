##  What is an Operating System?  

An **Operating System (OS)** is a **system software** that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware.  
It provides a platform for executing applications and manages the hardware resources efficiently.  

 Think of it as the **manager of a computer system** — it decides *which program gets the CPU, how memory is allocated, how files are stored, and how devices communicate.*  

This repository contains my **handwritten notes on Operating System concepts**, carefully prepared to help learners understand the fundamentals and advanced concepts of OS. These notes are structured for **students, interview preparation, and revision purposes**.

##  Objectives of an OS  

1. **Convenience** → Makes the computer easier to use.  
2. **Efficiency** → Manages resources (CPU, memory, I/O) efficiently.  
3. **Security** → Protects data and resources from unauthorized access.  
4. **Resource Management** → Fair allocation of CPU, memory, and I/O devices.  
5. **Abstraction** → Provides a simple interface to complex hardware.

## Why Learn OS?  

- Forms the **core subject** of Computer Science Engineering.  
- Heavily asked in **placements and technical interviews**.  
- OS concepts form the foundation for:  
  - **System Design**  
  - **Databases (transaction concurrency control)**  
  - **Networking (packet scheduling, resource sharing)**  
  - **Cloud Computing & Distributed Systems**
